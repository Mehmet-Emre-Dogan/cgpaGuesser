Guess your prospective CGPA.
## Automated Edition
It scrapes data from your transcript. However, not all school's transcripts are compatible. If you encounter problems, switch to the Manual Edition.
### Usage
- Download your transcript while ticking the "SEMESTER NO" box.
- Rename it to '1.pdf'. If your OS is not displaying file extensions, rename it to '1'.
- Move it to the directory containing the app.
- Run app.
## Manual Edition
Coming soon.
## Clarification about .exe files
I am unable to upload them due to:
- file size limit
- file count limit
- bandwidth usage limit (the first two can be overcome by file compressor, but this not)
